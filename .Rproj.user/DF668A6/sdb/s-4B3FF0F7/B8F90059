You will be exposed to a broad range of ecological and evolutionary principles, including applications in management and conservation. Both historical and contemporary research is emphasized. Readings are drawn exclusively from the primary literature. This course serves as a foundation for other, more specialized courses offered through the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology (EECB) graduate program. Topics will be introduced by guest experts, most of whom are part of the EECB faculty. \n\nSpecific topics to be covered include: physiological ecology, behavioral ecology, population ecology, natural selection and population structure, genomics research, epigenetics, speciation and macroevolution, phylogenetic reconstruction and the comparative method, community ecology, conservation, management and restoration, philosophy of science and biology, quantitative methods in ecological research.\n\n\n### Learning outcomes\nOutcomes of this class will include the following:\n    1. Students will be exposed to a broad range of ecological and evolutionary principles, including applications in management and conservation.  \n    2. Students will develop skills in critical thinking and communication through participation in and leadership of in-class discussions. \n    3. Students will gain skills in preparing for written and oral exams at the graduate level. \n\n### Grading\nYour grade for this course will be based on the following: \n    - Participation (70%)\n    - Final Exam (30%)\n*Grading scale*: A (100–93), A- (92–90), B+ (89–87), B (86–83), B- (82–80), C+ (79–77), C (76–73), C- (72–70), D+ (69–67), D (66–63), D- (62–60), F (below 60)\n\n### Final exam \nThe final exam will consist of short essay questions reflecting the diversity of material covered.\n\n### Participation\nAs discussed above, a major learning objective of this course is to develop skills in critical thinking and communication. The ability to intelligently discuss challenging issues is essential to success in graduate school, and my aim is to give you a jump start with this course. Come prepared every day to contribute. \n\n### Readings\nThe majority of the readings you will do in this class will be from the primary literature, as listed on the [\"Readings and Questions\" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkpM0Mn4-rWlnWKV_EqKXxwHbXxZWWWWC4jCEDZXlSY/edit?usp=sharing) on a weekly basis. You can expect to read approx. 4 papers per week. You are expected to seek out any additional references for areas that you feel you need help with. \n\n### Academic dishonesty\nAcademic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism or other dishonest behavior related to grades and performance) will not be tolerated under any circumstances. \n\n### Disability resources\nI encourage any student needing accommodations for a specific disability to please meet with me at their earliest convenience to ensure timely and appropriate accommodations.\n\n### Statement on Audio and Video Recording\nSurreptitious or covert video-taping of class or unauthorized audio recording of class is prohibited by law and by Board of Regents policy. This class may be videotaped or audio recorded only with the written permission of the instructor.  In order to accommodate students with disabilities, some students may be given permission to record class lectures and discussions. Therefore, students should understand that their comments during class may be recorded.\n\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\nrmarkdown::render('index.Rmd', 'word_document')\nrmarkdown::render('Calendar.Rmd', 'word_document')\n\n```\n\n",
