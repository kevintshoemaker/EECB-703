### Final exam
noon-3pm     
location TBA   
closed book; 10 short essays, ~300 words each, with questions chosen from a pool constructed as follows: from each of the 25 topics, I will pick 2 questions (so you'll see a list of 50 questions); I'll divide that list roughly into three parts (beginning, middle and end of the semester), and you'll have to pick 3 questions from the first, 4 questions from the middle and 3 questions from the end. 

In other words, you have a ton of choice, but you also can't completely ignore some section of the course! 

Although the exam is "closed book" and closed-internet, you can bring one sheet (8.5 x 11) of written notes, with writing on front and back.
